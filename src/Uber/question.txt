Goal: Implement a lightweight Java's Scheduled ExecutorService with three APIs:
schedule(Runnable command, long delay, TimeUnit unit)
Run a one-shot task after the specified delay.
scheduleAtFixed Rate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)
â†’ Run periodically at a fixed rate: executions are intended at 10+initialDelay, t0+initialDelay+period,
to+initialDelay+2*period...
scheduleWithFixed Delay (Runnable command, long initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit)
Run periodically with a fixed delay: each next start happens delay after the previous run finishes.
